		<h1>Jason Zhao</h1>
		<p>Hello, I'm currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> on the Edge Infrastructure team.  I work with the load balancers, reverse proxies, and caches that enable Squarespace process 2 TB of data and serve over 1.6 billion requests every day.  I'm interested in building systems that are highly available, scalable, and maintainable.</p>
		<p>Before Squarespace I was a student at <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>.  I graduated in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
		<p>During my time in school, I was an intern at <a href="https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/lab126">Amazon Lab 126</a> and helped publish a paper about <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.08437.pdf">Algorithmic Complexity Attacks</a> at CCS '17.</p>
